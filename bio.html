	<p class="container">I am a programmer with experience using Python, Java, Javascript, SQL, and web development. I also have completed many DIY and woodworking projects. I have worked on several theater productions building sets and as a stagehand.</p>
	<p class="container">I graduated from George School in 2016 where I studied AP computer science and robotics. I also recently graduated from a 20 week intensive course at Byte Academy, where I learned full-stack web development. When I have free time I like reading comics, playing video games, reading magazines like Popular Science or Make, and if my friends are around, playing or developing tabletop games.</p>
	<p class="container">I've traveled all around the world, to Vietnam, China, Indonesia, Canada, Cambodia, Thailand, Austria, Australia, New Zealand, England, South Africa, India, Hungary, Slovakia, and Russia, as well as the U.S. territories Guam and Saipan. I also lived in Japan for 9 years. </p>
	<p class="container">Ultimately, I want to make games, either video or tabletop as a designer or programmer.</p>
